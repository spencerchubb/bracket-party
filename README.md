Using brackets to elect the US president

# How the mechanism works
The mechanism works very similar to sports brackets.

1. Select initial set of candidates (should be a power of 2). The exact mechanism for this is to be determined.
2. In each round, candidates compete 1v1. Each voter is randomly assigned to a match. Voters decide who will move on to the next round.
3. The winner of the bracket will run in the general election.

# Why a bracket?

## Evaluate more candidates

In the US presidential election, only about 20 candidates have a shot at winning. Among those candidates, only a handful get careful consideration from voters.

In a bracket, each match is 1v1, so voters will make a more robust decision. It's much easier to compare two candidates than to compare many.

A bracket allows us to gather a bunch of pairwise comparisons and decide an overall winner. With n rounds of matches, we can robustly evaluate 2^n candidates.

## Understandable

Everyone in the US knows what a bracket is. They are commonly used in sports events such as March Madness.

An election system should be easily understandable so people trust the results.
